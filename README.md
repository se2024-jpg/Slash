- Social Media Login: Add support for different methods of login, such as Gmail, Facebook, or other social media accounts, to provide users with convenient and secure login options.
- Price Chart Visualization: Introduce a visual representation of price trends for products. This feature can help users understand historical price changes and make more informed purchasing decisions.
- UI Enhancement: Continue to enhance the user interface to provide an even better user experience. Consider improving aesthetics, user-friendliness, and overall design.
- Containerization: Implement Dockerization of the project to enhance its scalability, portability, and overall deployment efficiency.

## :thought_balloon: Use Case

- **_Students_**: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time to search for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites.Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.
- **_Data Analysts_**: Finding data for any project is one of the most tedious job for a data analyst, and the datasets found might not be the most recent one. Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually inportant.
